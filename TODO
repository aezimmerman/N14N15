1) Calculate ratios based on peptide/charge combinations, but not individual peptide-to-spectrum matched. That is multiple entries of the same peptide/charge combo (due to multiple MS/MS spectra) should be reduced to one.


3) figure out reportToTXT 
Does .Object@peptideIDs@peptide.to.protein.map has gene name redundancy?
I think it should contain redundancy.

3a) ***NOW*** Tweak the output. Make sure there are tables at 
   -) peptide level
   -) protein level. all peptides
   -) protein level. unique peptides
-- need to figure out decent filters first

4) HARD. parallelize quantify
